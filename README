==================================

Net::Traceroute:PurePerl - traceroute(1) functionality in perl via raw sockets

SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Traceroute::PurePerl;

    my $t = new Net::Traceroute::PurePerl(
				backend => 'PurePerl', # this optional
				host    => 'www.openreach.com',
				debug   => 0,
				max_ttl => 12,
				timeout => 2,
				packetlen => 40,
				use_alarm => 1,
				);
    $t->traceroute;
    $t->pretty_print;


DESCRIPTION

This module implements traceroute(1) functionality for perl5.  
It allows you to trace the path IP packets take to a destination.  
It is implemented by using raw sockets to act just like the regular traceroute.
You must have Net::RawIP installed. 
You must also be root to use the raw sockets.

OVERVIEW

A new Net::Traceroute::PurePerl object must be created with the I<new> method.
This will not perform the traceroute immediately, unlike Net::Traceroute.
It will return a "template" object that can be used to set parameters for several subsequent traceroutes.

Methods are available for accessing information about a given
traceroute attempt.  There are also methods that view/modify the
options that are passed to the object's constructor.

To trace a route, UDP packets are sent with a small TTL (time-to-live)
field in an attempt to get intervening routers to generate ICMP
TIME_EXCEEDED messages.

CONSTRUCTOR AND CLONING

    $obj = Net::Traceroute::PurePerl->new([base_port	=> $base_port,]
				[debug		=> $debuglvl,]
				[max_ttl	=> $max_ttl,]
				[host		=> $host,]
				[queries	=> $queries,]
				[query_timeout	=> $query_timeout,]
				[timeout	=> $timeout,]
				[source_address	=> $srcaddr,]
				[packetlen	=> $packetlen,]
				[trace_program	=> $program,]
				[no_fragment	=> $nofrag,]);
				[use_alarm	=> $use_alarm,]);
    $frob = $obj->clone([options]);
